	<h2>Sports</h2>
	<p>Swimming is probably one of my favourite hobbies I’ve had so far. 
	Ever since I was in 1st Grade, I took swimming lessons in a near-by swimming pool not only to develop swimming skills, but improve my athleticism as I was somewhat frail at that time. Once I started, it slowly made its way into my interests and I wanted to continue, even after I’ve succeeded with building up my athleticism. I decided to start going to swimming competitions and lifeguard courses.
	Below I will be briefly explaining what each one is and my experiences.

	<h2>Competitive Swimming</h2>

	<p>Competitive swimming is a sport where multiple people in a similar age group race against each other. They are usually organized in different strokes you’d like to do (eg. front crawl, back crawl, breaststroke, butterfly, etc) and the distance you are swimming. Your main goal is to achieve the fastest finishing time out of your competitors. The preparations for upcoming contests are usually very treacherous and often burn you out after each lesson. Click <span id="swimlink"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)#Competitive_swimming"><strong>here</strong></a></span> for more information about competitive swimming. From personal experience, 
	training starts off early in the mornings and ends around early afternoon while continuously swimming laps and building endurance and speed for each swimming style. Preparation often lasts 2-3 months but that fully depends on the intensity of the competition I was attending. Continuing to my competition experience, it was very nerve-wracking and usually a lot of pressure builds up before starting the race. I don’t really remember the details of each race from the adrenaline but in the end 
	I was not only rewarded with medals and ribbons but the feeling of accomplishment from my hard training.

	<h2>Lifeguard Lessons</h2>

	<p>
	Lifeguard Lessons teaches knowledge and practice of first aid, rescue procedures, and overall prepare individuals for emergencies in a given scenario. There are 3 main courses to take before you can apply for the actual National Lifeguard which is the certification needed to become a lifeguard. 
	The 3 courses consist of Bronze Star, Bronze Medallion, and Bronze Cross. I’ve taken all 3 of these courses and can I tell you, it was very tiring with frequent tests on knowledge and pretend-emergency-scenarios. Nonetheless, I’ve had fond memories of lifeguarding courses and made multiple friends out of awkwardness 
	and relating with each other’s struggles with this class. Overall, I learnt how to rescue people in both in-pool and on-land emergencies with the help of my peers. It’s a shame that many pools are shut down due to these times.
